# aemo-sra-solver (Work in Progress)

An LP solver designed on AEMO's Settlements Residue Auction (SRA) solver, but excluding linked bid functionality. This is an integer programming problem.

To run an instance of the LP solver, input bids and primary ($0 priced) and secondary (trader priced) allocation offers according to the data specification.

On the roadmap is setting up of AEMO data pipelines, and a pip package build.
