# aemo-sra-solver (Work in Progress)

The unofficial AEMO Settlements Residue Auction (SRA) solver, excluding linked bids. This is not endorsed by AEMO.

To run the LP solver, input bids and primary ($0 priced) and secondary (trader priced) offers according to the data specification.

On the roadmap is adding AEMO data pipelines and a pip package.

This package can be used to run a sensitivity analysis ie. discovering how adding offer/bid steps would impact the price.
